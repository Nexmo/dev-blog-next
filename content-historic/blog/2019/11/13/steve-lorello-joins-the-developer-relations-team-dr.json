With it, I&#8217;ve helped hundreds of developers with various integrations. Prior to which, I helped build Air Traffic Control Systems and more than one of those satellites we watch get launched from our backyards.</p>\n<p>Consequentially there&#8217;s a lot I&#8217;ve seen and done in the .NET world. Because of this, I know how many of you think and I have a lot of experience that I will bring to bear to make your integrations with Nexmo as frictionless and productive as possible.</p>\n<p>When I&#8217;m not at work, I take long runs with my dogâ€”a 15-month-old whippet named Zero. I watch a fair amount of baseball (Go Yankees!), football (American, go Steelers!). I&#8217;m also working on my graduate studies and I absolutely love to travel the world with my wife. We&#8217;ve been all over the Caribbean, US, UK, France, Italy, and most recently, Southeast Asia and Japan.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m looking forward to working with you all and building up our developer community at large and our .NET community in particular.</p>\n"}
