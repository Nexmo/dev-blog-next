My name is Michael Jolley and I&#8217;m a recent addition to the Developer Relations team here at Nexmo.</p>\n<p>I was born and raised in Birmingham, Alabama and have spent the last 20 years doing custom software development for companies ranging from start-ups to Fortune 500. My weapons of choice are primarily .NET and JavaScript, but I love learning other stacks as well.</p>\n<p>I also have a live-coding stream that can be found on <a href=\"https://twitch.tv/theMichaelJolley\">Twitch</a> every Tuesday, Thursday &amp; Sunday at 2pm ET/11am PT/6pm UTC. We always have a great time building interesting projects, including IoT controlled garden watering systems, Visual Studio Code extensions and more.</p>\n<p>If I&#8217;m not building something, you&#8217;ll probably find me hanging out with my family, playing music, or trying to exit VIM.</p>\n<p>I am really stoked to be on this amazing team and I&#8217;m looking forward to meeting and helping you in the future! If you&#8217;d like to connect, you can find me on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/michaeljolley\">Twitter</a>.</p>\n"}
