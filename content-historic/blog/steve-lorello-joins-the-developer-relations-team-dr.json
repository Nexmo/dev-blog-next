With it, I’ve helped hundreds of developers with various integrations. Prior to which, I helped build Air Traffic Control Systems and more than one of those satellites we watch get launched from our backyards.\n\nConsequentially there’s a lot I’ve seen and done in the .NET world. Because of this, I know how many of you think and I have a lot of experience that I will bring to bear to make your integrations with Nexmo as frictionless and productive as possible.\n\nWhen I’m not at work, I take long runs with my dog—a 15-month-old whippet named Zero. I watch a fair amount of baseball (Go Yankees!), football (American, go Steelers!). I’m also working on my graduate studies and I absolutely love to travel the world with my wife. We’ve been all over the Caribbean, US, UK, France, Italy, and most recently, Southeast Asia and Japan.\n\nI’m looking forward to working with you all and building up our developer community at large and our .NET community in particular."}
