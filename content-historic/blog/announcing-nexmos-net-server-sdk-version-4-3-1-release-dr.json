This week we are releasing a new version of the .NET SDK – 4.3.1. This version contains two bug fixes.\n\n## Truncated ‘loop’ Parameter in Stream and Talk Commands\n\nVersion 4.3.1 of the SDK fixes an issue where the ‘loop’ parameter would be truncated if set to 0 in Voice API Stream and Talk requests. Setting the loop parameter to 0 will now result in an infinite loop, as per the [API Spec](https://developer.nexmo.com/api/voice#startStream).\n\n## User Agent Throwing Exceptions for Certain Operating Systems\n\nThis version of the SDK also fixes an issue where on certain operating systems—specifically those whose description contains the `(` character (e.g. `Linux4.9.0-7-amd64#1SMPDebian4.9.110-3+deb9u2(2018-08-13)`)—a formatting exception would be thrown. This is because the Core CLR was interpreting the parentheses as comments in the user agent, without a preceding space, creating a formatting error. This was also an issue as the formatting of the User Agent wasn’t compliant with our [User Agent standards](https://github.com/Nexmo/repo-standards/blob/master/set-user-agent.md). From now on, the User Agent the SDK uses will be:\n\n`$\"nexmo-dotnet/{libraryVersion} dotnet/{languageVersion}\"`\n\nRather than including the full runtime (OS + .NET framework version), it will now only include the .NET version.\n\n## More to Come\n\nThere’s much more to come, but until then feel free to follow the [.NET SDK in GitHub](https://github.com/Nexmo/nexmo-dotnet) for real-time updates. If you have any questions, issues, or concerns, please feel free to raise them there or find me, @Steve Lorello, in our [community slack](https://developer.nexmo.com/community/slack), and I’ll be more than happy to help."}
