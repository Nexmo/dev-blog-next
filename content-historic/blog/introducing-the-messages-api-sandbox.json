If you don’t already have one, [you can sign up for free](https://dashboard.nexmo.com/sign-up?utm_source=messages-sandbox-intro&utm_medium=web) and get an initial €2 credit.\n\nOnce you have your account, you’ll also need:\n\n*   A smartphone with WhatsApp, Viber, or Facebook Messenger installed.\n*   A command line or terminal application.\n\n## Whitelist Yourself\n\nHead to the [Messages API Sandbox](https://dashboard.nexmo.com/messages/sandbox) in your Vonage API dashboard.\n\nThe first step is to whitelist your accounts. As the process is similar for all of the services supported, we’ll focus on WhatsApp in the External Accounts section.\n\n![External Accounts view in the Messages API Sandbox](https://www.nexmo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/external-accounts.png)\n\nClick the ‘Add to sandbox’ link to open the list of options. There are three ways to add a new account to the whitelist:\n\n1.  Scan the QR Code with your camera to open WhatsApp with a pre-defined message.\n2.  Send instructions to yourself, or another team member via email.\n3.  Send a message directly from WhatsApp to the number specified using the unique phrase shown.\n\n![Whitelisting options for WhatsApp](https://www.nexmo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/whitelist-options-small.png)\n\nRegardless of which method you choose, what you’re doing is linking the number and account ID you have set on your WhatsApp account to the API Key of your Nexmo account.\n\nYou’ll know it worked if the bottom of the whitelist section reads `You have 1 user(s) whitelisted`. If you don’t see this straight away, click the Refresh link.\n\nIf you would like to link a Viber or Facebook Messenger account, repeat the steps for each service.\n\n## Send Yourself a Message\n\nOnce your account is whitelisted, you can test it by sending yourself a message.\n\nTo do this, you can use Terminal on macOS and Linux or Command Line on Windows.\n\nCopy the code for the service you have chosen from the code block at the bottom of the screen.\n\n![The CURL command required to send a WhatsApp message](https://www.nexmo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/code-block.png)\n\nIt comes pre-filled with your API credentials, but you need to change the `$TO_NUMBER` to match the number of the account you previously whitelisted.\n\nPaste the code into your Terminal application. Hit enter and wait for the response from the server; it should look something like this:\n\n`{\"message_uuid\":\"7836a42b-7493-4ece-a7a7-3f59c5058471\"}`\n\nThen wait for the message to appear!\n\n![What the message looks like when it is received](https://www.nexmo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/received-message.jpg)\n\nPretty cool, right?\n\n## Connect to Your Application via Webhooks\n\nCURL is excellent and all, but we know you’re not here to send messages to yourself from the command line.\n\nTo give your application the ability to receive inbound messages from any of the supported services, you can set up an `Inbound` webhook.\n\n![The Webhooks Settings](https://www.nexmo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/webhooks.png)\n\nTo receive inbound messages, first ensure that your application has an endpoint to listen for messages on and that it can receive `POST` requests. You can call it whatever you like; we hear that `/inbound` is a popular choice.\n\nBefore you deploy your application to a server, you can use an app like [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com) to make it accessible to the outside world. There are more details on how to set this up in our [documentation](https://developer.nexmo.com/tools/ngrok).\n\nIt’s good to know what is happening to the messages your application sends. To help with this, we provide a `Status` webhook that reports any changes the occur along the delivery path.\n\nFor example, if you want to know if messages sent by your application are arriving, it would be reported via the status webhook using a `delivered` status. Although using this webhook is optional, it is an excellent choice to monitor it actively and record the data it sends you.\n\n## You Can Take It From Here\n\nThe Messages API Sandbox allows you to start working with WhatsApp, Viber, and Facebook Messenger quickly and easily. You can now connect any of these services to your new or existing applications, so what will you build with them?\n\nStart by digging into the [documentation for the Messages API](https://developer.nexmo.com/messages/overview).\n\nIf you’re looking for some inspiration, here are five other tutorials that we’ve created that might spark some ideas:\n\n*   [Save Received SMS Messages with Airtable and Node.js](https://www.nexmo.com/blog/2020/03/05/save-received-sms-messages-with-airtable-and-node-js-dr)—You could change this to store received WhatsApp, Viber or Facebook Messenger Messages.\n*   [Discover your Twitter Positivity Score](https://www.nexmo.com/blog/2019/07/01/discover-your-twitters-positivity-score-with-react-dr)—You could build on this React example and have it send the score via Viber or WhatsApp instead.\n*   [Scrape the Web and Send SMS Updates](https://www.nexmo.com/blog/2020/03/27/is-it-the-weekend-yet-build-a-web-scraping-app-with-sms-to-find-out-dr)—You could take this example app and have it send the results via WhatsApp.\n*   [Real Time SMS Translations with Node, React, and Google](https://www.nexmo.com/blog/2020/03/11/real-time-sms-demo-with-react-node-and-google-translate-dr)—Why not add to this application and get it to translate SMS, WhatsApp or Facebook Messenger messages?\n*   [Send and Receive SMS Messages with Node.js and Azure Functions](https://www.nexmo.com/blog/2020/01/29/how-send-receive-sms-messages-with-node-js-azure-functions-dr)—Try amending this Azure Function so it sends Viber messages instead of SMS.\n\nWhatever you’re building, we’re here for you if you need us.
