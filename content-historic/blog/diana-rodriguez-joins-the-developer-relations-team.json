My background is super diverse. I grew up in Venezuela and lived in many countries throughout my life.\n\nI am a polyglot on all counts, not only programming languages!. I speak Spanish, English, Portuguese, Italian, French, Thai, Mandarin, Swedish, Norwegian, Khmer, Lao, Malay and sign language. All the space in my head is containerized with Kubernetes and I have three pods, one of them for languages, another one for programming and the last one for music.\n\nMy background is mainly backend development with Python and infrastructure. I am passionate about DevOps and fostering collaboration between all sectors of the tech ecosystem and, especially advocating for diversity and inclusion. I believe that there is a place for everyone to sit at the table.\n\nWhen I am not nerding out, I like to play video games and/or board games. I am a big fan of rugby and your favourite #11 if I get to play. I have a black belt in Taekwondo and I am also a big fan of dining out and trying exciting food!.\n\nI look forward to engaging with our amazing community and all the goodness that are coming from that. Awesome things are in store for 2020 and the future!"}
