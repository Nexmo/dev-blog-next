My name is Zach Walchuk, and I’m excited to be joining the Nexmo team as a Developer Educator.\n\nI’ve spent time all over the American midwest—including Oklahoma City, Denver, and Madison—but I grew up and currently live among the snowy fields of Mankato, MN, surrounded by plentiful lakes and, in the non-winter half of the year, even more plentiful mosquitoes.\n\nFor the last five years, I’ve been helping developers solve problems across a variety of exciting technologies, ranging from AI to IoT to Identity and Access Management. I’m an engineer by training, but I’ve always had a passion for helping others navigate complex topics, both in writing and in person.\n\nWhile my programming language of choice is Python, I enjoy learning and debugging across all languages and technologies, and I try to build projects that highlight the problem being solved, regardless of syntax. I’m just as happy figuring out the best deployment option for an application as I am building the application itself, and occasionally I even find myself enjoying front-end work.\n\nOutside of work, I spend whatever time I have once the kids go to sleep writing and playing music, drawing, and reading. And in six months, if the snow has melted, I plan to spend some time out on the bike trails.\n\nI’m very much looking forward to working with the Nexmo and Vonage communities to help demonstrate, troubleshoot, and improve the communications APIs that developers rely on to make their apps a reality."}
