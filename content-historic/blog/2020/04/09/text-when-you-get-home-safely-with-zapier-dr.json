I always have good intentions of doing this, but after a late night I sometimes forget, or it can seem too complicated. So I made a little setup to make this easier for myself. And best of all? It uses no code at all. By linking a smart button to the <a href=\"https://zapier.com/apps/vonage-sms/integrations\">Vonage SMS integration</a> on Zapier, I can send a friend a message at the click of a button. Today&#8217;s post walks you through setting up something similar for yourself.</p>\n<h2>Set Up a Zapier Trigger</h2>\n<p>If you don&#8217;t have a Zapier account already, you can <a href=\"https://zapier.com/sign-up/\">sign up on their website</a>.</p>\n<p>Once you&#8217;re in, you&#8217;re going to make a new &#8220;Zap&#8221; (the name for a Zapier task) by clicking on the big &#8220;plus&#8221; button on the top left-hand side.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nexmo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/home-page.png\"><img src=\"https://www.nexmo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/home-page.png\" alt=\"screenshot of the Zapier user home page\" width=\"1280\" height=\"750\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-32018\" /></a></p>\n<p>The magic of Zapier is that it can wire one in-the-cloud thing to another. Our eventual destination is an SMS, but we will need an input trigger. I had a handy <a href=\"https://flic.io/\">flic button</a> lying around, but if there&#8217;s something else you&#8217;d like to use as a trigger, that would be fine too! Have a good browse around the treasure trove of options on Zapier and find something that suits your needs.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nexmo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/flic-button.jpg\"><img src=\"https://www.nexmo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/flic-button.jpg\" alt=\"photo of a cute blue flic button\" width=\"500\" height=\"484\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-32028\" /></a></p>\n<p>The flic button configuration takes three steps:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Decide what sort of event to use.</li>\n<li>Authenticate against your flic account.</li>\n<li>Set up which flic button and event (click, double click, or hold) will be the trigger.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nexmo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/flic-config3.png\"><img src=\"https://www.nexmo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/flic-config3.png\" alt=\"configuration screen with bluebutton and click selected\" width=\"1280\" height=\"750\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-32017\" /></a></p>\n<p>Click &#8220;Continue&#8221;, and the event is now ready.</p>\n<h2>Send an SMS</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nexmo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/then-sms-zap.png\"><img src=\"https://www.nexmo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/then-sms-zap.png\" alt=\"search for vonage and choose the Vonage SMS integration\" width=\"1280\" height=\"750\" class=\"size-full wp-image-32125\" /></a></p>\n<p>Now configure the SMS to send when the button is pressed using your <a href=\"https://dashboard.nexmo.com/sign-up?utm_source=DEV_REL&amp;utm_medium=github&amp;utm_campaign=text-when-you-get-home-safely-with-zapier\">Vonage API account</a> information.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Search for Vonage and choose the &#8220;Vonage SMS&#8221; app.</li>\n<li>Choose &#8220;Send SMS&#8221;.</li>\n<li>Authenticate with your credentials to link your Vonage API account with Zapier.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Now, the fun part!
