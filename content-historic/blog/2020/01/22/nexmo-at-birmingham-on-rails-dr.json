This year we are excited to join the inaugural <a href=\"https://birminghamonrails.com/\">Birmingham on Rails</a> conference in Birmingham, Alabama on Friday, January 31st. The free conference is entirely community-driven and seeks to bring further opportunities for learning and networking to the American Southeast Ruby developer community. The conference will be keynoted by Sandi Metz and Stephan Hagemann. Sandi needs no introduction to the Ruby community. She is the author of <em>Practical Object-Oriented Design</em> and <em>99 Bottles of OOP</em>. Stephan is a leading thinker as well in Rubyâ€™s performance and maintainability, and the recent author of <em>Component-based Rails Applications</em>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.nexmo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Ben_Greenberg_Headshot.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"108\" height=\"104\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-31098\" /> Ben Greenberg, Nexmo&#8217;s Ruby Developer Advocate, will be one of the eight speakers at the conference and will be presenting on building Ruby applications that leverage natural language processing and semantic analysis. In his talk, <em>What&#8217;s Love Got To Do With It?</em>, Ben will break down some of the foundational concepts of how machines process human language, and in the process will share insights from linguistics and behavioral psychology. He will then demonstrate practical applications of this technology to build socially connected Ruby apps to glean insight on the &#8220;mood of the news&#8221;.</p>\n<h2>Are You a ðŸ’Ž Rubyist and Live in Alabama?
