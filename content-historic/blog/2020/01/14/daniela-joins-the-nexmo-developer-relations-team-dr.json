I am Daniela, and I am really excited to be joining Nexmo as Developer Education Coordinator.</p>\n<p>I am originally from Italy, but I have been calling London my home since 2012.</p>\n<p>I grew up in a small town on Lake Iseo (the least known of all the Italian lakes, but definitely the prettiest!). Before London, I lived in Milan, Birmingham, and Athens.</p>\n<p>I studied media and communication, and I have been working in content and marketing for the past 10 years, mainly for online travel companies.</p>\n<p>A year and a half ago, I decided that I wanted to try and learn to write code, so I attended a course of Front End Development at General Assembly. I soon realized that I enjoyed learning to code so much that I wanted to move to a job that would allow me to learn more about developers and tech communities. So here I am!</p>\n<p>In my spare time, I love traveling and hiking. I have a big passion for stray dogs and, whenever I can, I try to combine my trips with some volunteering time at dog shelters around the world.</p>\n<p>Officially I work remotely, but I am planning to spend time in the London office as well. I am really looking forward to working at Nexmo and helping to coordinate our Developer Education efforts.</p>\n"}
