My name is Nahrin, and I’m delighted to be joining the Nexmo Developer Education team.</p>\n<p>Before moving to Canada over a decade ago, I had the privilege of living in some truly spectacular countries, including Sudan, Mali, Djibouti, Kenya, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Tajikistan, and Haiti. Although I still enjoy exploring new places, I’m now happy to call Toronto home. Toronto is a terrific place to live, and I love kayaking through the surrounding Great Lakes or catching a Raptors basketball game in my spare time.</p>\n<p>As I&#8217;ve taken a non-traditional route to software engineering, ensuring that technical education is accessible to all is especially important to me. To this end, I have taught software development to students of varying demographics as an educator at <a href=\"http://uforchange.org/creative-intensive/graphic-design-and-web-development/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">UforChange</a> and <a href=\"https://www.canadalearningcode.ca/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Canada Learning Code</a>. Additionally, I have built a STEM learning management system using React.js and Python, judged and mentored at hackathons, and coordinated numerous technical workshops and events as Lead of <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/Women-Who-Code-Toronto/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Women Who Code Toronto</a>.</p>\n<p>Now, as Nexmo’s newest Developer Educator, my work revolves around creating resources that help and inspire developers using our communications APIs. This role deeply incorporates my passions for cutting-edge technology, education, and community—and I could not be more excited to have landed here.</p>\n<p>If you’d like to connect, you can find me on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nahrinjalal?lang=en\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a> or the <a href=\"https://developer.nexmo.com/community/slack\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Nexmo Community Slack</a>.</p>\n"}
