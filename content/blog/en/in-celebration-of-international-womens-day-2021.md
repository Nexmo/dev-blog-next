Each year, in honour of International Women's Day, the global Vonage community comes together to celebrate the incredible journeys, stories and voices of our colleagues and the amazing people around us. 2021 is no exception.

## Stories and Journeys From Our Colleagues

In [2020](https://www.nexmo.com/legacy-blog/2020/03/10/in-celebration-of-international-womens-day-2020), we began the tradition of collecting personal stories from the Vonage community for Dev.to's "[Nevertheless, She Coded](https://dev.to/devteam/shecoded-2021-stories-from-women-building-software-and-the-allies-supporting-them-49pf)" initiative. Dev.to's annual celebration has blossomed into a beautiful collection of experiences, with each voice adding powerful perspective, wisdom, and advice.

## International Women's Day 2021 Panel

To kick off the celebrations for International Women's Day 2021, we held a panel discussion with some of our Vonage leaders on March 2, 2021. Featured speakers Amitha Pulijala, Danielle Vergara, Lauren Lee, Marina Serrano Montes, and Nahrin Jalal provided insight into their experiences, both as women and as advocates for women in technology. Through their stories, we learned how they navigated the tech industry and what their experience has taught them. Watch the recording on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/d-cvjT4lROs)!

## In Closing

We are proud to be elevating voices and shining a light on issues women and non-binary folks face in the software industry this International Women's Day. Together, we can **choose to challenge** and call out gender bias and inequity. We can choose to seek out and celebrate women's achievements. Collectively, we can *all* help create a more inclusive world.
