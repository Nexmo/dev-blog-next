OneHack Academy is Vonage's internal 'learn to code' course, and we are making it available to everyone. Through 6 classes you'll learn how to design and build web pages, how to write JavaScript, store data, and use several Vonage APIs.

It is designed to be a useful piece of reference material that you can keep coming back to, as most videos cover a single topic and are less than 10 minutes long.

## Who this is for

This course is perfect for everyone - from people who have never written any code before right through to experienced developers looking to refresh and strengthen their core web development skills.
